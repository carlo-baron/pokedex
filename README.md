# Program Overview
This is a simple Pokédex that displays the Pokémon's: Name, Abilities, Types, Base Stats, EV Yield, and Sprite.

This is also a revision of my original Pokédex, which I made during my early days of programming using the `pypokedex` Python library. [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/iscyprit/Pokedex-pypokedex-tkinter-)

# Develoment Logs
I've added a web version with basically same functionalities but you can change the sprite to their shiny version.

# Usage
Type the name of the Pokémon or its corresponding Pokédex number and hit Enter.

Click the Pokémon's sprite to play its cry.

You may also get Pokémon forms using this format: `{pokemon-name}-{form}`, e.g., Zacian-crowned. The PokeAPI documentation provides more information about this.

# Note
It uses VLC to play the Pokémon's cry. If you prefer not to use VLC, you can modify the code accordingly.
